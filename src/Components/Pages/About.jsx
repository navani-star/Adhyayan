      <p className='fs-5'>First of all, I would like to congratulate you on taking the first step towards achieving your dream. We all have different dreams and this is what makes us unique.</p>

      <p className='fs-5'>Let me explain the vision behind Adhyayan IT Training and Placement. I started Adhyayan IT Training and Placement to fulfill my dream of imparting quality training to my professionals. I have also dreamed of myself as a trainer by passion, a Python programmer and Data Scientist by skill, and a lifelong student by outlook. During the course of my professional career, I realized the significant gap between the academic content taught in schools and colleges, and its practical usage in actual industrial scenarios. This academia-industry mismatch has made people get stuck in a career/technology/job, which they either do not enjoy or are not skilled at.</p>

      <p className='fs-5'>Based on these problem statements, I decided to start Adhyayan IT Training and Placement as a training institute where the primary aim is improving and niche technical skills to professionals and students. Our focus is to ensure that the student develops a thorough understanding of the technology, so that one enjoys her job. If you find a job you love, you will never work again. This led us to develop our technical courses from scratch, wherein the student was made the center of our project. The idea was to breakdown the concepts in such a manner that everyone is able to understand them, and a live practice of these concepts so as to enforce understanding of these concepts. This was not an easy task. We had to take feedback from our students after every class, and redesign our teaching methodology so that everyone is able to understand the projects. The selection of practical examples was a challenging task because they have to clear the concept and develop an understanding of real-life industry use cases. The major and minor projects are carefully selected to ensure that our students have some basic understanding when they start their career.</p>

      <p className='fs-5'>Our focus is to spark the student's interest in technology so that learning becomes a fun activity. The students should enjoy the coding process, should be always willing to upgrade their knowledge, should actively participate in hackathons and coding conferences, and should be an active seeker and contributor of knowledge in the open source domain. This is only possible if one has developed a clear understanding of concepts, and has the ability to utilize this knowledge in the practical domain. I promise you that when you complete a course from Adhyayan , you will have developed a passion for coding because you will learn to enjoy it.</p>

      <p className='fs-5'>Another unique feature of Adhyayan IT Training and Placement is that we have dedicated brainstorm groups/evangelical groups for all the courses offered by the institute. These groups consist of lead mentors from prestigious institutes like IIT and IIM, working professionals from the industry, as well as students. Regular meetings of these groups are conducted to ensure that the syllabus content is in tune with the demands of the industry. The major and minor projects offered as part of the course are meticulously screened by the group to ensure that they offer value addition in terms of developing a broad understanding of the industry requirement of a particular technology. This is the reason that 80% of the time in our classroom sessions is devoted to hands-on experience by working on live projects in the class.</p>

      <p className='fs-5'>Passionate Professionals, Students in college, a fresher or an industry veteran, our pedagogy is designed to develop understanding of concept.</p>
